`# Chess Tutor Chatbot

Welcome to the **Chess Tutor Chatbot** project! This project leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to create an interactive chatbot that can answer questions related to chess. The chatbot uses a vector store (FAISS) for efficient document retrieval and combines the retrieved documents with the language model to generate accurate and informative responses.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: Users can ask questions about chess and receive informative responses.
- **Document Retrieval**: The chatbot retrieves relevant documents to provide contextually accurate answers.
- **Customizable Interface**: The interface includes custom images and backgrounds to enhance user experience.
- **Seamless Integration**: The chatbot runs on Streamlit, making it easy to deploy and interact with.

## Access Chess Tutor Chatbot Online

The Chatbot can be accesses for free at [https://chesstutor.streamlit.app]
For more information about the chatbot, see [https://chesstutor.streamlit.app/About]
